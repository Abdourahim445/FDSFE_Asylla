Data Analysis using DBSCAN

In this homework, I leaned how to use kaggle and analyzed the provided data using DBSCAN
and data cleaning. I plotted the data on histograms to determine the relationships between 
different data points and  plot a box and whiskers plotted of the distribution to find
features for each cluster. Finally, I produced a tsne 2d projection of scaled_data and
plotted it, colored by cluster.
