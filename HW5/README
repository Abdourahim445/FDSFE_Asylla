I worked on my own.

Homework 5, logistic regression.
In this homework, we looked at different features in a data frame and analyzed their behavior in contrast to each other.
After analysis, we fit the data to a linear model for further observation and we found the precise percentages of the model's performance for each class
and identified the correctly, incorrectly and closely read predictions. We also plotted a confusion matrix graph to find the positive 
and negative predictions.
