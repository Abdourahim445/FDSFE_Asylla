In this project, I explored Neural Networks in-depth, crafting two Artificial Neural Networks and one Convolutional Neural Network. I tackled the assigned task through multiclass classification and regression approaches. Building the CNN for multiclass classification posed the greatest challenge, requiring meticulous effort and problem-solving. I navigated this journey independently, leveraging online resources to enhance my understanding.
