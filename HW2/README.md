what the homework was about?

The homework was about checking students Exam scores and how different variables affect those scores.

what you learned (one or two may take home points for you from doing the exercise. Can be the analytical aspects or some practical method to do things)

I understood the correlation analysis map even more and how to read it.

who you worked with

By myself.

what you contributed specifically into the group work (if this assignment was hard for you and you do not feel like you were leading any aspects 
of it that is ok! I am asking you to state this to ensure you do some introspection and check your progress throughout the course)
